# Sandra: Discord Bot
Sandra is a powerful multi-purpose Discord bot focused on form and function with users in mind.

Add Sandra to your own server by clicking [here](https://sandrabot.com/invite) and enjoy all of her features!

**We do not support attempting to build or run Sandra by yourself. We will not help you.**
This repository is solely to provide transparency and for the community to contribute to the project.

**Note**: This repository does not reflect the current codebase used in production.
Code here is being rewritten from the ground up in Kotlin in preparation for Sandra version 5.
